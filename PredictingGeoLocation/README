Predicting Geolocation using Machine Learning

Localization is the task of determining the physical coordinates of a sensor node (or a group of sensor
nodes) or the spatial relationships among objects. It comprises a set of techniques and mechanisms that
allow a sensor to estimate its own location based on information gathered from the sensorâ€™s environment.
While the Global Positioning System (GPS) is undoubtedly the most well-known location-sensing system,
it is not accessible in all environments (e.g., indoors or under dense foliage) and may incur resource costs
unacceptable for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
In this work, we used WinPropTM software suite are provided by AWE Communications for extracting geo
spatial information from simulation. The ProMan Propagation software package is designed to predict the
path loss accurately between transmitter and receiver including all important parameters of the mobile
radio channel. The ProMan (Network) software offers network planning modules for 2G/2.5G, 3G/B3G,
WLAN, WiMAX networks. It offers Static network planning modules as well as dynamic network simulators
We propose nonlinear polynomial regression as a machine learning method to obtain excellent results on
predicting emitter location.
