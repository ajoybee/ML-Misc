## Simple application of LSTM (Long short-term memory) using keras with tensorflow as backend.
It trains LSTM network with sequence of numbers as shown in the picture below:

                          |----------|
                          |   LSTM   |
21 34 55 89 144 233 377 =>|  Model   | => 610 987
                          |----------|

It was Developed and tested on google colab: https://colab.research.google.com
Also test on centos 7 and windows 10.
